The North Carolina Life Insurance agent promised to fly from Mercy to the other side of Lake Superior at three o'clock. Two days before the planned flight he tacked a note on the door of his yellow house: At 3:00 p.m. on Wednesday, February 18, 1931, I will take off from Mercy and fly away on my own wings. Please forgive me. I loved you all. Signed Robert Smith, insurance agent. Few people arrived because word traveled slowly.
